- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** present products online for promotion with the ability to sell and buy more easily
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app. 
All traders in the formal and / or informal sector can present their products, which will be available to any category of people on the market
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on his needs, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First user can zap into the list of shops and see their contents, then login or create a shop.
